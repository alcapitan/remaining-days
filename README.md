# Remaining days

## What is it ?

This is a Python program that calculates the number of days before an event.  
This program was made to work with an Arduino [Grove-LCD RGB Backlight](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LCD_RGB_Backlight/) v4.0 .  
I warn you that the compatibility and installation of this material is complicated. I don't own this, I borrowed it from my high school at the time of its conception.  
If you have this device, set the `arduino_mode` variable to `True` to have the display on the Arduino as well as in the Python console.  
This program can print text in English or French.  

## Why I did it ?

I coded this during my last days of computer classes in high school. It was intended for my teacher Mr. CHARNOZ.  
By the way, the hidden feature of this program is that if you don't set any parameters in the `run()` function, it will target my teacher's retirement day because he was protesting for it.
